# Git & GitHub

## Git
Git is a versioning software that sits on your local computer and aids in the tracking of changes for **code files**. You'll need to [download Git] on your computer. Think of it as a digital ledger that tracks the changes in any document over time. 

## GitHub
[GitHub] is a website that hosts remote repositories (read: repos) that hold an entire project's folders, files, and version history for each file. Repos can be private or public, meaning only you can see them or anyone on the internet can see everything in the repo, respectively. 

You can check out the [GitHub documentation] for more info about GitHub... it's pretty user-friendly!

You can interact with GitHub in 4ish ways: CLI (command line interface), the website, through your IDE (VS Code), and the GitHub Desktop app. If you're using the command line for the first time, this [Command Line Cheat Sheet] would be a helpful reference.

When you interact with GitHub, you're usually connecting your local repo (on your computer) and the remote repo (on GitHub) in some way. Here are several basic terms you'll use when getting started:

### GitHub Jargon to Get Started
- [add] - specifies which files you want to be committed - you really only use this when you're using the CLI
- [commit] - saves a change you've made to the respective branch you're in (either the main or a side branch), a commit acts as a snapshot of the file at the time of the commit
- [push] - updates the remote repo with the changes made locally
- [pull]- gets the most recent version of the remote repo to your local repo
- [branch] - a version of your project where you are making changes (like adding a new feature) but not changing the base branch. This is helpful if you want to try something out without accidentally messing up your main branch.
- [merge] - updates the base branch with the updates proposed in a pull request
- [fork] - a copy of a repo on your own account, changes can be made to this new forked copy without affecting the original repo (unless you submit a pull request and they accept it!), any changes made to the original branch can be pulled to your fork
- [pull request] - propose changes to a repo, a pull request is made in a branch, so it does not affect the base branch until approved
- [fetch upstream] - gets all the new changes from the remote repo (or original repo, in the case of a forked repo) without merging
- [clone] - copies your remote repo to your local machine

Here is a [GitHub Cheat Sheet] that is a helpful reference while you get comfortable using git commands.

### Use Cases
Let's say you have a repo set up for an app you're building and just added a developer to help you build out the app. You have a public remote repo already set up, but since it is your project, only you have permission to make changes to it.

#### Use Case 1: Bug fix
You need to fix a bug you've recently discovered in your app. You assign your new developer to fix the bug. 

    They will:

        1. Fork the project repo to their GitHub account and clone it to their local computer.
        2. Make the changes to the code to fix the bug. 
        3. Add, commit, and push the changes to their forked branch of the repo.
        4. Submit a pull request to add the changes to your original repo.

    Then, you will:
    
        1. Review the changes and decide whether they are sufficient to fix the bug and haven't affected anything else.
        2. If they pass your assessment, you can merge these changes to the base or main branch.

#### Use Case 2: Adding a new feature
You want to build out a new "share" feature in your app without affecting the functionality of the existing code. 

    You will:

        1. Pull the most recent version of the remote repo to your local - you want that updated bug fix!
        2. Create a new branch to build out the new feature. We'll name it "add-share-feature". 
        3. Build and test your new feature code on the "add-share-feature" branch. You add, commit, and push your changes to this branch.
        4. When your new feature is complete, you can create a pull request to merge your "add-share-feature" branch to the main branch.
        5. After doing a final review, you can merge your branches and your new feature will be added to your main branch.

#### Use Case 3: Using GitHub in Class
Ok - more realistically you'll probably interact with GitHub the most in your classes right now. Your professors may host their materials on GitHub and you'll want to be able to get the up-to-date materials as they are added. You'll also want to be able to have any code files, like a homework .ipynb file, they share available to run on whatever environment you have chosen. Here's how that looks:

    They will:
        1. Set up a repo on GitHub with the course materials. Let's say they add the files to the repo weekly, so each week they add the new files you'll need for that week.
    
    You will:
        1. Fork the repo and clone it to your local machine.
        2. Before each class, you'll fetch upstream and get the new files added as well as any updates they've performed since you last pulled and merge them to your branch. You can open these files from your local in whatever environment you use (VS code, Jupyter, Google Colab, etc.)
        3. You may add notes or complete homework assignments that you store in your own repo. When you make changes you're happy with, you'll (add, commit, and) push these to your own forked copy of the repo. These won't go to your instructor's copy unless you make a pull request to do so.

# Next Steps:
- Make sure you have Git installed on your computer (run `git --version` in a terminal if it returns a version of git... you have it!) or download Git if needed​

- Use the linked documentation to set up a GitHub account and local connection​

- Fork this Python Support Hours repo, clone it to your local machine, make a change locally, and (add, commit, and) push it to your repo​. Check that you can see the new change on GitHub.

- Make a change in your repo on GitHub and save it there. Pull the updated version to your local machine and check that you get the updated version on your machine.

- Check out this [Software Carpentry] page to help you get started with git and github! This walks you though a case study on setting up git repos and using git/github throughout a project. It's also a great introduction to using git from the command line!
